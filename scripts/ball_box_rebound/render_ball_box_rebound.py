# the sill lands at 1.02 m and the head at 2.15 m, which is where a real window

# grey-yellow slabs hanging in the room, one of which passes straight through
# the play area. They are hidden and replaced with real lights.

# The printed road-map play mat goes because the balls would otherwise cross a

# south wall and two open sides -- and it is mapped into a shared texture atlas,
# so it can be neither tiled nor enlarged. The ball's run-up alone is 1.15 m and
# the camera has to stand behind it, which puts every usable camera position
# past the edge of that quad and its far side in frame as a hard line with
# nothing under it. They are replaced by a real tiling hardwood floor (see
