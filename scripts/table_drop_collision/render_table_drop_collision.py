"""Blender/Cycles renderer for a tennis ball rolled off a coffee table.

Imports assets/models/living_room.glb, calibrates it into the physics world
frame, puts two tennis balls in it -- one on the round coffee table and one on
the floor beside it -- runs simulate_table_drop_collision.py and replays the
result as keyframes.

Run through Blender, not python:

# --- Room model calibration ---------------------------------------------------
#
# assets/models/living_room.glb is a small, tidy model -- 18 meshes -- and unlike
# the other flat in this project its objects at least carry meaningful material
# names, in pinyin: `zuozi` is the table, `diban` the floor, `shafa` the sofa,
# `qian` the wall. The mesh names themselves are still Object_NN, so every
# constant below was measured by raycasting the imported model rather than read
# off a name, and VERIFY_OBJECTS checks each one at import time.
#
# It is not in metres. The scale is fixed on the round coffee table, which is
# what the scene is about and which comes in standard sizes: 900 mm across is
# the common one, and the model's table is 1.2435 units at its widest.
#
# Four independent checks agree, all of them on the sofa, which is the other
# thing in the room whose real dimensions are not a matter of taste:
#   - the seat cushions land at 0.421 m, which is a sofa seat;
#   - the top of the back lands at 0.804 m;
#   - the sofa is 2.209 m wide, a three-seater;
#   - and 0.982 m deep.
# The room comes out 3.49 m floor to ceiling, which is tall -- but the model is a
# double-height space with a 3.15 m glazed wall, and the render shows exactly
# that, so it is the model and not the scale.

#   +x           runs east,
#   +y           runs north, toward the sofa.

# The dressing is *kept*, and it is the reason the launch lane is where it is.
# Hiding it would have handed the ball the whole 0.9 m of table to aim across and
# it was tempting, but it is the only thing in the shot that gives the top a

# elevation the bars fall straight across the lane the ball is rolled down. A
# 67 mm ball crossing a hard shadow edge every few frames reads as the ball
# changing colour rather than as the light, which is the one thing this shot

# tune. What tells them apart on screen is only how old they are -- the one on

#
# The shot is laid out to run *across* that camera rather than at it. The ball

# before the glazed wall, against 0.21 m past the table's rim to the east, where
