# assets/models/modern_living_room.glb is a SketchUp-style export: it is not in
# metres, and every one of its 124 meshes is named "Material2.0NN", so nothing
# in it can be found by name without measuring it first. Everything below was
# measured by raycasting the imported model, and the constants are checked
# against each other by VERIFY_OBJECTS at import time.
#
# The unit is fixed by the one dimension in a kitchen that is standardised: the
# worktop. It sits at model z = 37.219, and the bar table's top is the *same*
# surface -- the two are flush, and a raycast walks from one to the other with no
# step at all -- so taking the worktop as 0.90 m fixes the scale.
#
# Four independent checks agree, which is why this is the number and not a
# guess:
#   - the interior ceiling lands at 2.571 m, and the wall cabinets run exactly
#     up to it (they are modelled to the ceiling, as fitted cabinets are);
#   - the window's sill lands at 1.058 m and its head at 2.010 m;
#   - the coffee table's top lands at 0.404 m and the sofa's seat at 0.421 m;
#   - the bar stools' seats land at 0.718 m, which is a bar stool for a 0.90 m
#     counter.

# -- Cycles renders what it geometrically is, a dull mustard slab across the
# ceiling, and the room has no light in it at all.
#
# The face is given a real emission shader (on its own copy of the material, so

# 0.5 it halves the panel's output and greys everything under it, including the

#
# 100 mm is a large marble and 50 mm an ordinary one; on a 0.579 m deep table
# the big one covers a sixth of the depth, which is big enough to read as an
# object rolling on a surface rather than a dot on a plan.

# Framing: a low three-quarter from the room's north-east, 1.17 m above the
# floor -- 0.27 m above the table top -- chosen from a survey of twelve positions
# (kept in renders/tmc_camera_survey/, cam_survey.py regenerates it).
#
# Every candidate stands north of the table, because that is the only side there
# is: the south edge is against a wall, the east end is 67 mm from a wardrobe,
# and the west end runs into the kitchen worktop.
#
# The angle was picked for one property the prettier candidates do not have: the
# whole shot stays in frame from the launch to both marbles at rest. The view
# down the table's length from the east end had the best depth of the twelve --
# the top receding toward the kitchen with a daylit window behind it -- but the
# struck marble rolls *toward* that camera and leaves frame before it stops, so
# the last 15 frames have only one ball in them. For a reconstruction clip the
# two balls' relative position is the content, and it has to be legible in the
# last frame as much as the first.
#
# The distance was then set by a second round that walked the camera in along
# this sight line. At 35 per cent closer the marbles read about twice the size
# and the frame stops being mostly bare wall, but the launch clipped the right
# edge. **That was fixed by shortening the run-up rather than by backing the
# camera off** -- `launch_x` moved from -0.780 to -0.620 with the push dropped
# from 1.42 to 1.31 m/s to compensate, which puts the marble in frame at the
# launch and reproduces the old arrival speed to 2 per cent and both resting
# positions to 2 cm. Moving the subject is nearly always the cheaper fix; the
# camera position is load-bearing and the run-up was not.
#
# Half the standoff was also rendered and is the best-looking of the lot -- the
# impact fills the frame and the top's reflection comes alive -- but no amount of
# shortening the run-up puts the launch back in it, and a collision scene that
# does not show the ball being sent has given away its premise.
#
# It is also low on purpose. The subject is two balls 100 and 50 mm across on a
# horizontal surface; from standing height they flatten into dots on a plan, and
# what makes them read as objects rolling on a table is being near the height of
# the table itself. The bar stools help here rather than getting in the way --
# their backs stop 0.106 m *below* the table top, so they read as a foreground
# frieze without ever crossing the line the marbles roll along.
